VAPI: ASSESSMENT OF FLOOD DISCHARGE IN ITALY.

This MATLAB code aims to automate the assessment of flood discharges occurring in Italy. 
1) The input parameters are digitized in the files 'prpb', 'time_int' (time interval), and 'tr' (return period).
2) The input parameters 'm_hg' and 'm_hh' are explained in the code and fixed for each location of interest, available in the isometric maps within the folder in the repository.
3) The area of interest is adjustable within the code in the parameter 'z', following the commented indications in the preamble.

The program output consists of the IDF curves. IDF curves, or intensity-duration-frequency curves, are mathematical functions that relate the intensity of an event (e.g., rainfall) with its duration and frequency of occurrence. These curves are commonly used in hydrology for flood forecasting and civil engineering for urban drainage design. The frequency is the inverse of the probability of occurrence. The IDF curves provide a graphical representation of the probability that a given average rainfall intensity will occur within a given period of time. This allows for the estimation of the return period of an observed rainfall event or conversely, the rainfall intensity corresponding to a given return period. The curves are developed using rainfall data and can be influenced by various factors such as the type of rain gauge used, the duration of the rainfall event, and the return period. The curves are essential for designing hydraulic structures, such as drainage networks, road culverts, bridges, and other water management systems. In the context of climate change, updating IDF curves to reflect future climate scenarios is necessary to ensure the design of stormwater infrastructure is adapted to changing rainfall patterns.
